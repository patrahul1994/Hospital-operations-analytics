# Hospital-operations-analytics
Healthcare hospital operations analytics using SQL, focused on patient flow, operational metrics, and decision-oriented analysis.

# Healthcare Hospital Operations Analytics (SQL)

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital operations data to support operational efficiency and decision-making in a healthcare environment. The focus is on transforming raw hospital data into actionable insights using SQL.

## Business Problem
Hospitals require clear visibility into patient flow, length of stay, and operational performance. Without structured analytics, inefficiencies and bottlenecks in care delivery are difficult to identify.

## What This Project Does
Using representative hospital data, this project:
- Analyzes patient admissions and discharges
- Calculates operational metrics such as length of stay
- Aggregates visit-level and patient-level information
- Demonstrates healthcare-focused analytical SQL logic

The emphasis is on analytical reasoning and query structure rather than dataset size.

## Key SQL Concepts Used
- Multi-table JOINs
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- CASE WHEN conditional logic
- Aggregations and GROUP BY
- Date-based analysis

## Tools & Skills
- SQL
- Healthcare operations analytics
- Analytical problem-solving

## Why This Matters
Operational analytics helps hospitals improve patient throughput, optimize resource utilization, and support timely decision-making. This project demonstrates how SQL supports real-world healthcare operations analysis.
